I have always been passionate about sailing since my teenage years. Sailing to me is more than a sport; it is a way of living that reconnects you with nature and your true self within it.

Sailing to me is more than a sport; it is a way of living that reconnects me with nature and my true self within it. This profound connection emerges not just from the freedom and adventure of navigating the open waters, but also from the comprehensive skill set required. It demands an understanding of the weather and physics, which fuels the sense of adventure and the exhilarating experience of harnessing nature's power. 

Additionally, knowledge of flora and fauna, along with practical skills like carpentry and engine maintenance, enhances this experience. 

Sailing requires physical strength and mental lucidity, contributing to the feeling of becoming one with the rhythm of the sea. These aspects intertwine to create a holistic and fulfilling sailing experience that embodies both the thrill of exploration and the serene escape from everyday life catering to a full range of emotions.

I have sailed mostly in the Mediterranean, in the Irish Sea, and in the English Channel. I have the RYA Coastal Skipper qualification and in my spare time during summer, I volunteer as a sailing instructor at Centro Velico Caprera, which is the second oldest and biggest sailing school in Europe. 

Hopefully one day I will own a small sailboat to be able to solo sail and explore the seas.
