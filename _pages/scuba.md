I have been getting passionate about SCUBA diving for the past 5 years reaching the _Divemaster_ qualification with 80+ dives. 

The sensation of being weightless, floating among sea creatures, is both exhilarating and peaceful, offering a unique way to connect with nature. Mentally, diving can be incredibly relaxing and meditative. It requires monitoring your environment and equipment in the serene quiet of the underwater world where the only sound is your own breathing.

Here are some photos of my first Divemaster internship in Tenerife, Canary Islands.
