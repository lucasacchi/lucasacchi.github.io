During two years of my master's at ETH Zurich, I have been part of project NAUTILUS within the ARIS collaboration, a spin-off of ETH of more than 170 students. 

The goal of the NAUTILUS project is to build a Modular Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) for research purposes of better understanding climate change.

We are building an autonomous underwater glider with silicon soft robotics wings for high maneuverability and energy efficiency, enabling the study of small bodies of water with less invasive methods than traditional ROV. It will be to make measurements in lakes and glaciers. 

Here are some photos of the team and various pools and lake tests we did.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
